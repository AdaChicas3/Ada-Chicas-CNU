### Final Reflection

   In the very start of this course I was somewhat of a lost puppy. I never really thought of the humanities aspect in literature or technology. At the beginning of the course I was told to write a brief description of what I thought Digital Humanities was, but I struggled coming up with something so I searched it up. Of course, Google told me, "Digital humanities is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies." So, I went by this definition for a few weeks. 

From the very start of digital humanities, I was lost and didn't really understand what the course really consisted of. After being in the course for almost five months, I can proudly say my definition of what digital humanities is has changed. It's roughly the same as before except not coming from Google, instead it comes from my own thoughts and experiences I have had during the course. 

So what is Digital Humanities? It's the study or concept that connects literature, art, history and technologies in order to bring together and discipline the computational tools and methods to traditional humanities tools. 

Over the course we read several articles and tweeted our opinions as well as any questions we had related to the topic of the week. One of my favorite readings we did this semester was called ***Shitty First Drafts***.
  
In this article the author discussed how stressful writing a first draft can be. As someone who is constantly writing papers after paper, I never related to something so much. I remember tweeting about the article and finding it so easy to relate and tweet about. I even mentioned how freaked I tend to get when it comes to others reading my mistakes or in this case ***Shitty First Drafts***.

The reason I enjoy this reading the most is because of how much I can relate to writing a terrible first rough draft. During this course, I felt that many of my first drafts were unreadable but having the peer reviews really helped me conquer the embarrassment of others reading my first drafts. 

The peer reviews were also a major help throughout the entire course, having my peers read and comment on my first drafts helped me guide my papers and blog posts for the better. I did enjoy the change of pace at the end of having different people from our usual read our drafts and comment on them. I liked having a fresh pair of eyes look into my work and comment on what I could do better in my work.  

Although reading and relating to many of the articles we read was a lot of fun, my absolute favorite thing we did in this course was coding. I always assumed coding for websites like these or using markup language was the hardest thing on the planet. Once I really got the hang of XML it became the easiest project we had to do in the course. 

It wasn't always that easy, I found it time consuming during the very beginning. Almost frustratingly, Sometimes my markups wouldn't show up and all I was missing was a simple colon or a chevron in the middle of a sentence. Once I really got the hang of the language I found myself zooming through the assignment. 
  
I like to think that having Github and learning the markup language really helped me for that activity. It would be satisfying to watch my markup language turn into images, bolded words, or simply adding a couple hashtags for a main header.

I really enjoyed using the website and learning the language. I wish we had more time using Github rather than leaving it behind after the TEI project. Initially, I assumed that we would be working with Github all semester but to my surprise we had the pleasure to work on creating a grant. Making this grant possible was difficult; I had gotten the experience of working through the process of brainstorming an idea, writing the draft and proposing it to win funds. After weeks of editing, I finally was able to submit my project which gave me a sudden feeling of relief. Although, part of me couldn't help but realize that turning my grant in would mean classes would soon be ending.  

As a writer and as a student, I have grown. Compared to how I was the first week during this course, I feel a lot more confident with the subject. I find it easier to write about the digital humanities aspect, especially after struggling for so long to grasp the concept.

 It is bittersweet moment having the course come to an end but knowing that I will be able to take everything Deanna Stover was able to teach me and apply it in other courses makes up for completing the course.
