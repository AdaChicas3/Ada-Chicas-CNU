### Final Reflection

  In the very start of this course I was somewhat of a lost puppy. I never really though of the Humanitites aspect in literature or technology. At the begginning of the course I was told to write a brief description of what I thought Digital Humanities was, but I struggled coming up with something so I searched it up. Of course, Google told me, "Digital humanities is an area of scholarly activity at thhe intersection of computing or digital technologies." 

  I went by this definition for awhile, but I still grasp the concept. Over the course we read several articles and tweeted our opinions as well as any questions we had related to the topic of the week. One of my favorite readings we did this semester was called ***Shitty First Drafts*** 
  
  In this article the author discussed how stressful writing a first draft can be. As someone who is constantly writing paper after paper, I never related to something so much.
