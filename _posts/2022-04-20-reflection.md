### Final Reflection

  In the very start of this course I was somewhat of a lost puppy. I never really though of the Humanitites aspect in literature or technology. At the begginning of the course I was told to write a brief description of what I thought Digital Humanities was, but I struggled coming up with something so I searched it up. Of course, Google told me, "Digital humanities is an area of scholarly activity at thhe intersection of computing or digital technologies." 

  I went by this definition for awhile, but I still grasp the concept. Over the course we read several articles and tweeted our opinions as well as any questions we had related to the topic of the week. One of my favorite readings we did this semester was called ***Shitty First Drafts*** 
  
  In this article the author discussed how stressful writing a first draft can be. As someone who is constantly writing paper after paper, I never related to something so much. I remember tweeting about the article and finding it so easy to realate and tweet about. I even mentioned how freaked I get when it comes to others reading my mistakes or in this case ***Shitty First Drafts***

Although reading and relating to many of the articles we read was a lot of fun, my absolute favorite thing we did in this course was coding. I always assumed coding for websites like these or using markup language was the hardest thing on the planet. Once I really got the hang of HTML it became the easiet project we had to do in the course. 

Although it wasn't always that easy, I found it time consumming during the very beggining. Almost frustrating, Sometimes my mark ups wouldn't show up and all I was missing was a simple colon or a chevron in the middle of sentence. Once I really got the hang of the langauge I found myself zooming through the assignment. 
  
I like to think that having Github and learning the mark up language really helped me for that activity. It would be satisfying to watch my mark up language turn into images, bold a word, or simply adding a couple hashtags for a main header.
