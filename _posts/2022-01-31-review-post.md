**SUMMARY**
  
  
  According to the project managers “The Data and Visualisation internship project at the University of Edinburgh had as its core aim to geographically locate and visualise the different locations recorded within the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database.” (Scott) Witchfinder General is a Swedish digital humanities project that covers locations of residence accused of being witches. With over _3000_ different accusations, project manager Ewan takes us on an educational journey with locations and records of everyone who was accused of being a witch in [Great Britain] with additional information of place of death as well as names of those who were accused of witchcraft.

  Taking a first look at the project, you notice very small issues. Although, the website is very interactive and filled with maps and small details about the witches, it appears to be far too much. Each tent on the map provides place of death, gender, occupation, etc., but we recieve a lack of context to go with the interactions of each map on the site. The names on the map are linked to a '_more info_' option where the link takes you to another site connected to The University of Edinburhg resulting in a bigger text format of details provided on the map. This is an excellent way to demonstrate the following information on the maps but adding another tagged link to more on the investigaions could lead to a bigger interest and following for the project.
