## **SUMMARY**
<br />
  According to the project managers Witchfinder General is a Swedish digital humanities project that covers locations of residents accused of being witches. With over 3000 different accusations, project manager Ewan takes us on an educational journey with locations and records of everyone who was accused of being a witch in [Great Britain] with more information.

<br />
  Taking a first look at the project, you notice very small issues. Although the website is very interactive and filled with maps and small details about the witches, it appears to be far too much. Each tent on the map provides a place of death, gender, occupation, etc., but we receive a lack of context to go with the interactions of each map on the site. The names on the map are linked to a 'more info' option where the link takes you to another site connected to The University of Edinburgh resulting in a bigger text format of details provided on the map. This is an excellent way to demonstrate the following information on the maps but adding another tagged link on the investigation could lead to a bigger interest and following for the project.

 ![Toolbar](https://AdaChicas3.github.io/Ada-Chicas-CNU/images/toolbar.png)
<br />
 The toolbar on the website is very easy to navigate, having them titled what the maps would be about, for example, _residences with timeline, residence within each parish, detention locations, trial locations,_ etc., with that being said a tool it lacks is a search bar option. Having a search tool on the website could potentially help the audience search for certain information they are looking for. The search bar tool is a helpful and faster way to get certain information or land on a specific somewhere on the site; This would not only help the site manage what information is most popular with the public but it would also allow the viewer to find specific information. This addition to the toolbar would also allow the site to add more information that the site lacks as mentioned previously.
