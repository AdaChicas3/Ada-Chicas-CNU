**SUMMARY**
  
  
  According to the project managers “The Data and Visualisation internship project at the University of Edinburgh had as its core aim to geographically locate and visualise the different locations recorded within the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database.” (Scott) Witchfinder General is a Swedish digital humanities project that covers locations of residence accused of being witches. With over _3000_ different accusations, project manager Ewan takes us on an educational journey with locations and records of everyone who was accused of being a witch in [Great Britain] with additional information of place of death as well as names of those who were accused of witchcraft. 


**MAPPING** 


  Taking the first look at the project, you notice very small issues with the project. Although, the website is very interactive and filled with maps and small details about the witches who were accused the website lacks any explanation. Each tent on the map provides place of death, gender, occupation, etc.,
