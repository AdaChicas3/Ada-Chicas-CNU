Hello! I bet you're wondering who am I am; So I am here to give you a little inside scoop of myself! My pronouns are _she/they_ and I am a Junior at ![Christopher Newport Univeristy](https://https://cnu.edu) majoring in English with a minor in Liguistics. I've found that I am very intrigued in learning more about various cultures and languages. With that in mind, I can speak English and Spanish fluently and am currenly teaching myself Japanese and Korean! 


I am from Woodbride, Va and I played Varisity soccer for my high school team as well as 3 years on a travel soccer team. I have a cat that I love and adore with my whole heart and soul named Jason who is only _2_ _years_ old! I am really into music like most of my genration, I believe that music is a unviersal language which can connect us all. I am super into Kpop, Jrock, RnB, Pop and basically any song that I like the lyrics of. I love streaming and watching streamers whether its on youtube or twitch, but when I'm not gaming I am training at the gym! 


I am a first gen so being able to graduate from a University is a huge blessing. Afer graduation I am hoping to continue my education and receieve my masters, but before that can happen I will be taking a year off to travel the world, or _at least_ the countries and places on my list! As for Digital Humanities, I want to be able to take everything I will learn from this course and use it on my journey across the world so that others can follow my journey. With the useful resources, I can also allow my writing to help others who need help with traveling and saving money or even reach out to other first gen students out there that there are many possibilities out in the world for them!
