Hello! I bet you're wondering who am I am; So I'm here to give you a little inside scoop of myself! My pronouns are _she/they_ and I am a Junior at Christopher Newport University majoring in English with a minor in Linguistics. A little about me, I've found that I am very intrigued in learning more about various cultures and languages. With that in mind, I can speak **English** and **Spanish** fluently and I'm currently teaching myself **Japanese and Korean**! Learning languages is one of the many hobbies that I love to do. The ability to understand a foreign language and communicate with others even if it is at a basic level is amazing!

I am from Woodbridge, Virginia and I played Varisity soccer for my high school team as well as 3 years on a travel soccer team. I have a cat that I love and adore with my whole heart and soul named Jason who is only 2 years old! I am really into music like most of my generation, I believe that music is a universal language which connects us all. I am super into _Kpop, Jrock, RnB, Pop_, and basically any song that I like the lyrics to.


I love streaming and watching streamers whether it's on youtube or twitch, but when I'm not gaming I am training at the gym! For the past 4 months, I have been olympic weightlifting, specifically in resting power cleaning. I enjoy putting the work in and seeing the progress I make training and it's a good substitute for soccer!

I am first gen so being able to graduate from a University is a huge blessing. After graduation I am hoping to continue my education and receive my master's, but before that can happen I will be taking a year off to travel the world, or _at least_ the countries and places on my list! As for Digital Humanities, I am taking the course for credit purposes but I want to be able to take everything I learn from this course and use it on my journey across the world so that others can follow on my own personal blog!

With the useful resources, I can allow my writing to help others who need help with traveling and saving money or even reach out to other first gen students out demonstrating the many possibilities out in the world for them! Traveling has always been a dream of mine and I've never been able to travel because of _school or the lack of money_, but once school is over and I gather all my savings I will finally be able to live out my dream! 



As for school involvement here at CNU I unfortunately am not involved in any clubs but I have over _100_ hours volunteering at VCU hospital where I took care of children twice a week! My freshman year of college I went to VCU and during my time there, I looked over the children making sure they were fed, slept and had enough social interaction! I adored volunteering and getting to know each and every one of my kids, I had the younger classroom and the kids weren't any older than **5 years old**. The youngest child we had was 3 and although he was the youngest he clung onto to me almost **_immediately_.** Although its not an academic accomplishment, I value the opportunity and learning process and consider it a **huuuge** accomplishment. 



So thats a little _about me_, I hope you enjoyed me picking bits and pieces out of my brian in order to introduce myself to you! I tried very hard... if it wasn't enough for you, shoot me a DM on my [class account](https://twitter.com/AdaChicas3) or don't... **_no pressure_**

Until the next post! _Goodbye, Adios, 안녕히 가세요, さよなら_!
