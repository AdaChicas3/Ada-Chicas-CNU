Hello! I bet you're wondering who am I am; so I am here to give you a little inside scoop of myself! My pronouns are _she/they_ and I am a Junior at ![Christopher Newport Univeristy](https://https://cnu.edu) majoring in English with a minor in Liguistics. I've found that I am very intrigued in learning more about various cultures and languages. With that in mind, I can speak English and Spanish fluently and am currenly teaching myself Japanese and Korean!
