Hello! I bet you're wondering who am I am; So I'm here to give you a little inside scoop of myself! My pronouns are _she/they_ and I am a Junior at Christopher Newport University majoring in English with a minor in Liguistics. I've found that I am very intrigued in learning more about various cultures and languages. With that in mind, I can speak English and Spanish fluently and am currenly teaching myself Japanese and Korean! 



I am from Woodbride, Virginia and I played Varisity soccer for my high school team as well as 3 years on a travel soccer team. I have a cat that I **love and adore with my whole heart and soul** named Jason who is only _2 years_ old! I am really into music like most of my generation, I believe that music is a unviversal language which connects us all. I am super into Kpop, Jrock, RnB, Pop and basically any song that I like the lyrics too. I love streaming and watching streamers whether its on youtube or twitch, but when I'm not gaming I am training at the gym! For the past 4 months I have been olympic weightlifting, specifically in *resting* power cleaning. I enjoy puttting the work in and see the progress I make training and its a good substitute for soccer!

I am a first gen so being able to graduate from a University is a huge blessing. Afer graduation I am hoping to continue my education and receieve my masters, but before that can happen I will be taking a year off to travel the world, or _at least_ the countries and places on my list! As for Digital Humanities, I want to be able to take everything I will learn from this course and use it on my journey across the world so that others can follow my journey on my own personal blog! With the useful resources, I can allow my writing to help others who need help with traveling and saving money or even reach out to other first gen students out demonstrating the many possibilities out in the world for them! Traveling has always been a dream of mine and I've never been able to travel because of _school or the lack of money_, but once school is over and I gather all my savings I will finally be able to live out my dream! 


Unfortunately I am not involved in any clubs here at CNU but I have over _100_ hours volunteering at VCU hospital where I took care of children twice a week! My freshman year of college I went to VCU and during my time there, I looked over the children making sure they were fed, slept and had enough social interaction! I adored volunteering and getting to know each and every one of my kids, I had the younger classroom and the kids weren't any older than **5 years old**. The youngest child we had was 3 and although he was the youngest he clung onto to me almost **_immediately_.** Although its not an academic accomplishment, I value the opportunity and learning process and consider it a **huuuge** accomplishment.
