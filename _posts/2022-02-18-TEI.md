## TEI Review

#### Learning Coding 
For this project I was given a passage from _Draculas Guest_ by Bram Stoker. My assignment was to tag and code the text provided to me by Dr. Deanna Stover starting with a Google docs and then moving into a program called Oxygen. As someone who has never worked with coding or any sort of markup language, I began to think this project would be a difficult task. With the help of my professor and taking baby steps beggining on the google docs I was g=flying through the markup language.
