## TEI Review

#### ***Learning Coding*** 
For this project I was given a passage from _Draculas Guest_ by Bram Stoker. My assignment was to tag and code the text provided to me by Dr. Deanna Stover starting with a Google docs and then moving into a program called Oxygen. As someone who has never worked with coding or any sort of markup language, I began to think this project would be a difficult task. With the help of my professor and starting off my coding on the google docs I was flying through the markup language in no time. 


#### ***Google Docs***

Here, I am demonstrating the Google Doc where I began using the markup language. I began with highlighting the page begginings, quotes, endings of a paragraph etc., Of course, this part was the easiest. I had to go through the text and find the language I needed to markup, I went through and left small notes in order to help me code in the program "Oxygen." While my text from _Draculas Guest_ didn't need a lot of markups, I highlighted what I did have while also including notes shared by my professor.

#### ***Oxygen***

Once I moved onto the program Oxygen I was able to begin marking my text and it was very overwhelmings to say the least. I had all my markings finished but it was opening the program and seeing the screen below that scared me. Because I have no past experience using XML or HTML, even with instructions given by my instuctor I doubted myself and on he abiliiy to achieve the markups correctly. Blindly using the tags, I went ahead and did my best in order to constuct a proper text that could be seen on the "Authors" point of view tab.

From this point, I was able to use the markup language and see the progress
