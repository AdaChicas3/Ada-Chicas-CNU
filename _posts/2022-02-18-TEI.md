## TEI Review

#### Learning Coding 
For this project I was given a passage from _Draculas Guest_ by Bram Stoker. My assignment was to tag and code the text provided to me by Dr. Deanna Stover starting with a Google docs and then moving into a program called Oxygen. As someone who has never worked with coding or any sort of markup language, I began to think this project would be a difficult task. With the help of my professor and sstarting with baby steps beggining on the google docs I was flying through the markup language. 


#### ***Google Docs***

Here, I am demonstrating the Google Doc where I began using the markup language. I began with highlighting the page begginings, quotes, endings of a paragraph etc., Of course, this part was the easiest. I had to go through the text and find the language I needed to markup, I went through and left small notes in order to help me code in the program "Oxygen."

#### ***Oxygen***

From Google Docss, I was able to begin marking my text through "Oxygen" and it was very overwhelmings seeing the actual markup language in thr program.
